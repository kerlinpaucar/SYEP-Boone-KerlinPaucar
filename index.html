    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hey, I’m Kerlin! I’m a high school student who enjoys listening to music, playing volleyball, and spending time with my dog. I like being around people I’m close with and just having fun when I can. I try to stay positive and open to new experiences, even if they’re a little outside my comfort zone. I’m still figuring out what I want to do in the future, but I’m taking it one step at a time. For now, I’m just focused on enjoying life and learning more about myself.</p>
